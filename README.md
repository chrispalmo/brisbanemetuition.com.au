# brisbanemetuition.com.au

This repository is where the website for my tuition business ([brisbanemetuition.com.au](https://brisbanemetuition.com.au)) is hosted.

This site is a static export of a wordpress press made several years ago. It was amazing to see how much junk is generated and imported by wordpress and the various plugins used - it is no surprise why Wordpress sites are notoriously slow.

I cleaned it up just enough to make it work - while there is an endless list of improvements that *could* be made, I am simply leaving it "as is" due to the time investment that would require. It is a simple marketing site that satisfies its requirement of marketing a simple business.
